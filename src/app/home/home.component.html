            Paving the way for future improvements on WVU's favorite mode of transportation!
            This projectâ€™s purpose is to record, process, and display the electrical power 
            that the Personal Rapid Transport (PRT) system uses. For the first iteration, the user interface was created to present some previously captured test bed data. This iteration 
            displays data fetched from the cloud database, with options to view the data in both log and graph format.
            This project is meant to be build upon, and this interation was intended to lay the groundwork of the web application stack,
            and database data flow models so that they will be set up for working hardware in the future.

            A modular Raspberry Pi 4 Model B microcontroller equipped with a sensor suited to measure the PRT's power is the basis of all
            that is to come. In the first iteration, the focus was on a testbed that lays the foundation for this ultimate goal. A PWM ciruit
            used in conjunction with an ADC on the RPi simulated the RPi collecting analog voltage data. In this iteration, Python scripts are stored within a Docker container, and wirelessly 
            accessed through SSH and executed on the RaspberryPi from the host machine. 
            This Python script generates data that is then sent to the MongoDB Atlas database, and this data is accessed 
            from this MEAN stack web application to view and analyze.
